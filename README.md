# Student Dropout Analysis Project

## Overview

The Student Dropout Analysis Project is a comprehensive solution to address the critical issue of student dropouts in educational systems. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project, which combines data analytics, machine learning, and a user-friendly web interface to provide insights, recommendations, and real-time monitoring for reducing dropout rates.

## Features

- User Authentication: Differentiates between Government, Schools, Parents, and Educational Institutions.
- Data Input: Allows seamless input of datasets related to student attendance and dropout rates.
- Data Preprocessing: Ensures data consistency and integrity through preprocessing techniques.
- Real-Time Tracking: Provides real-time tracking of dropout rates for Government and Educational Institutions.
- Algorithm Selection: Automatically selects and applies various machine learning algorithms for analysis.
- Insights: Reveals insights into dropout rates and the significant factors contributing to them.
- Policy Recommendations: Generates evidence-based policy recommendations for Government and Educational Institutions.
- Data Visualization: Displays results through graphical representations for easier understanding.
- Parental Monitoring: Allows parents to monitor their child's academic performance and receive alerts if they are at risk of dropping out.
